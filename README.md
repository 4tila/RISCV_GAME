# RISCV_GAME

The idea of this game written in assembly (risc-v) is to work similar to a game engine, where basic routines that run gravity, collision detection, generation of image on the display and AI mechanics are already written and the design of levels can be done mostly if not entirely by writing portions of memory. The program "load.py" was used for level design
